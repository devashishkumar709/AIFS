 Nowadays Rate of Failure at StartUp is High. The Main area behind this is the motive of the Entrepreneurs. The entrepreneur aims to look for a solution and then find a problem to sync the solution with it. The Result is No or less customer base with in turn will cause the startup to go into losses and eventually shut down.
To solve this issue we have a platform which provides the ability to search for a startup idea and see if itâ€™s been done before and if it was a success or a failure.
Users can Rate any idea they like and also see the rating of an Idea. Any Entrepreneur can see this idea and may start with it. They will decrease the chances of failure as the idea with the high ratings will have less chances of failure.
